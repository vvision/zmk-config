zmk-config
==========

My configuration for a custom built split keyboard.
Based on the Aurora Corne from [splitkb](https://splitkb.com).

Uses [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) with [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano).

## Layouts

1. QWERTY: Base qwerty layout with home row mods.
2. SYMBOL: All symbols and numbers, with a focus of recurring symbols used in programmation.
3. DIACRITICS: Diacritics for French language. 
4. NAVIGATION: Arrows (pad style) and other helpers (Copy/Paste, Insert/Delete, ...). Right side with numpad.
5. FUNCTIONS: Left side with function keys from F1 to F12. 
6. ADJUST: Bluetooth + Volume + Media + available space for shortcuts/macro.

## Visualisation

To view all layouts in a graphical way, use [keymap-drawer](https://keymap-drawer.streamlit.app/) (Also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer)).
