zmk-config
==========

My configuration for a custom built based on the Aurora Corne from splitkb.

Uses [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) with [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano).

## Layouts

1. QWERTY: Base qwerty layout with home row mods.
2. SYMBOL: All symbols, with a focus of recurring symbols used in programmation.
3. CONTROL: Numbers + arrows (vim style).
4. ADJUST: Function + bluetooth + media.
5. SHORCUTS: Numpad + available space for shortcuts/macro.

## Vizualisation

To view all layouts in a graphical way, use [keymap-drawer](https://keymap-drawer.streamlit.app/) (Also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/caksoylar/keymap-drawer)).
